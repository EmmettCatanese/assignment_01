"""
bill.py — the Bill Splitter module.

This is a *module*: a collection of small, reusable functions. None of them read
input or print anything — they just take values in and return a value out. That's
what makes them easy to test (see tests/test_unit.py) and easy to reuse from the
console, notebook, and Streamlit interfaces (console.py, explore.ipynb, dashboard.py).

Your job: implement the four functions below so the Unit Tests in
tests/test_unit.py all pass. Each docstring says exactly what the function should
return — replace the `# TODO` line (and the `pass`) with your code.
